Sur la Table has theirs in calendar form where the class listed on a date is clickable and leads out to the sign up page. https://www.surlatable.com/sku/4083952/Global+Flatbreads it makes it easier for people to figure out their own schedule and start the payment for the class. https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/41207?hl=en-->

			<h3>Sonya Tiratsuyan: Founder</h3>
			<p>Sonya was always in the kitchen with her grandmother, almost always elbow deep in food. She started cooking on her own at the ripe young age of 9: simple roast chicken soon evolved into more complex dishes, and she began experimenting with sauces, textures, and unique flavors. Sonya knew she wanted to be a teacher after her very first day of pre-school, and her passion for food seemed the perfect match.</p>
