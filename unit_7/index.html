			<h3>Sonya Tiratsuyan: Founder</h3>
			<p>Sonya started cooking on her own at the ripe young age of 9: simple roast chicken soon evolved into more complex dishes, and she began experimenting in the kitchen. Sonya knew she wanted to be a teacher after her very first day of pre-school, and her passion for food seemed the perfect match.</p>
